Edgar hears this through a speaking tube, and plots to eliminate the cats. Therefore, he sedates the cats by sleeping pills in their food, and enters the countryside to abandon them. There, he is ambushed by two hounds, named Napoleon and Lafayette, and the cats are stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence. In the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O''Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly hitchhike in a milk cart before being chased off by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, but Marie falls into a river and is saved by O''Malley; himself rescued by two English geese, Amelia and Abigail Gabble, who accompany the cats to Paris. Edgar returns to the country to retrieve his possessions from Napoleon and Lafayette, as the only evidence that could incriminate him.  Travelling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet O''Malley''s friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the scat song Ev''rybody Wants to Be a Cat. After the band has departed, O''Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Here, Duchess'' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O''Malley''s proposal of marriage. Duchess and the kittens return to Madame''s mansion, but Edgar places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to Timbuktu; whereupon they direct Roquefort to retrieve O''Malley. He does so, and O''Malley returns to the mansion, ordering Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. This done, the alley cats and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. In the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself.

In Horroxs plantation, he witnesses the whipping of a Moriori slave, Autua, who later stows away on the ship. Autua confronts Ewing and convinces him to advocate for Autua to join the crew as a free man. Dr Henry Goose slowly poisons Ewing, claiming it is the cure for a parasitic worm, to steal Ewings valuables. As Goose administers the fatal dose, Autua saves Ewing. Returning to the United States, Ewing and his wife Tilda denounce her fathers complicity in slavery and leave to join the abolition movement. <h3>Cambridge/Edinburgh, 1936</h3>  Robert Frobisher, a young English composer, finds work as an amanuensis to aging composer Vyvyan Ayrs, allowing Frobisher the time and inspiration to compose his own masterpiece, "The Cloud Atlas Sextet". Frobisher begins reading Ewings journal, which he has found with the latter portion missing, among the books at Ayrss mansion. Ayrs demands credit for "The Cloud Atlas Sextet" and threatens to expose Frobishers homosexuality if he refuses. Frobisher shoots Ayrs and flees to a hotel, where he uses the name Ewing. He finishes "The Cloud Atlas Sextet" and commits suicide with a gun just before his lover Rufus Sixsmith arrives. <h3>San Francisco, 1973</h3>  Journalist Luisa Rey meets an older Rufus Sixsmith, now a nuclear physicist. Sixsmith tips off Rey to a conspiracy regarding the safety of a new nuclear reactor run by Lloyd Hooks, but is killed by Hookss hitman, Bill Smoke, before he can give her a report that proves it. Rey finds Frobishers letters to Sixsmith and tracks down a vinyl recording of Frobishers "Cloud Atlas Sextet". Isaac Sachs, another scientist at the power plant, passes her a copy of Sixsmiths report. Smoke kills Sachs by blowing up his plane and runs Reys car off a bridge. She escapes but the report is destroyed. With help from the plants head of security, Joe Napier, Rey evades another attempt on her life, which results in Smokes death. With another copy of the report obtained from Sixsmiths niece, she exposes the plot to use a nuclear accident for the benefit of oil company executives, who are indicted as a result. <h3>London, 2012</h3>  Sixty-five-year-old publisher Timothy Cavendish reaps a windfall when Dermot Hoggins, the gangster author of Knuckle Sandwich, murders a critic who gave the novel a harsh review, generating huge sales. When Hogginss brothers threaten Cavendishs life for Hogginss share of the profits, Cavendish asks for help from his wealthy brother, Denholme, who tells him to hide at Aurora House. On the way there, Cavendish reads a manuscript of a novel based on Luisa Reys story, and recalls his relationship with a woman named Ursula. He visits the house where she lived with her parents and discovers that she still lives there. Believing Aurora House is a hotel, Timothy signs papers "voluntarily" committing himself; in fact, Aurora House is a nursing home (in Ayrss old mansion). Denholme reveals to Timothy that he sent him there as revenge for Timothys affair with Denholmes wife Georgette. The head nurse, Noakes, is abusive, and contact with the outside world is denied.

He exposes Sonmi to the larger world, including the banned writings of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and a film version of Timothy Cavendishs "ghastly ordeal". They are found and Sonmi is captured. Hae-Joo rescues her, introduces her to the leader of the rebel movement, and shows her that clones are not freed at the end of their contract but killed and recycled into food for other clones. Sonmi makes a public broadcast of her story and manifesto. The authorities intervene to halt the broadcast; Hae-Joo is killed in the firefight and Sonmi is recaptured. After recounting her story to an archivist, she is executed. <h3>Big Isle (Hawaii), 106 winters after the Fall (2321)</h3> Zachry Bailey lives in a primitive post-apocalyptic society called the Valley on the Big Island of Hawaii.[13] The Valley tribesmen worship Sonmi-451; their sacred text is taken from the broadcast of her manifesto.

Catkin, Zachrys niece, falls sick, and in exchange for saving her, Zachry agrees to guide Meronym to the station, where Meronym reveals the true story of Sonmi-451.
